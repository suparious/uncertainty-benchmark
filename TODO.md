# Solution Refinement and Progress Tracking

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Created proper dataset loading utilities in `dataset_utils.py`
- ✅ Fixed the MMLU dataset loading to properly handle categories
- ✅ Updated `main.py` to use the new dataset utilities
- ✅ Added a simplified `quick_test_fixed.py` for basic verification

## Pending Refinements

1. **Dataset Improvements**:
   - Implement proper handling for the HaluEval datasets instead of using mock data
   - Add capability to cache datasets to avoid reloading them for each benchmark run
   - Add support for custom dataset paths

2. **API Integration**:
   - Enhance the API integration to better handle different response formats
   - Improve error handling for the logit extraction process
   - Add support for batch processing to speed up evaluation

3. **Parallelization**:
   - Add parallel processing capabilities for large-scale evaluations
   - Implement batch processing of test samples to reduce API calls

4. **Result Storage**:
   - Consider implementing a database or structured storage solution for results
   - Add capability to resume interrupted benchmark runs
   - Implement versioning for benchmark results

5. **Visualization Enhancements**:
   - Add more detailed visualizations for uncertainty analysis
   - Create interactive dashboards for result exploration
   - Implement comparison views across model families

6. **Evaluation Enhancement**:
   - Add capability to only run specific conformal score functions 
   - Add capability to run only specific prompt strategies
   - Implement temperature testing to evaluate model robustness

## Usage Notes

- Use `quick_test_fixed.py` for a basic verification of the setup
- For MMLU dataset, make sure you have enough disk space as it's a large dataset
- When running the full benchmark, consider starting with a smaller sample size first
