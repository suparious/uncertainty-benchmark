# Solution Refinement and Progress Tracking

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Created proper dataset loading utilities in `dataset_utils.py`
- ✅ Fixed the MMLU dataset loading to properly handle categories
- ✅ Updated `main.py` to use the new dataset utilities
- ✅ Added a simplified `quick_test.py` for basic verification
- ✅ Fixed handling of different answer formats for robust error handling
- ✅ Created `examples_small.py` for testing with smaller sample sizes

## High Priority Optimizations

1. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Implement batch processing of samples for API requests
   - Add concurrent API calling using Python's `asyncio` or `ThreadPoolExecutor`
   - Create progress indicators that properly track parallel operations
   - Add configurable batch size and parallel worker count

2. **Task Parallelization**:
   - Enable parallel evaluation of different tasks
   - Enable parallel evaluation of different prompt strategies
   - Add capability to distribute workload across multiple processes

3. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Implement caching of dataset loading and API responses
   - Add memory usage optimizations for large datasets
   - Add checkpointing to resume interrupted benchmark runs

## Quality and Feature Improvements

1. **Dataset Improvements**:
   - Implement proper handling for the HaluEval datasets instead of using mock data
   - Add support for custom dataset paths

2. **API Integration**:
   - Enhance the API integration to better handle different response formats
   - Improve error handling for the logit extraction process

3. **Result Analysis**:
   - Add more detailed visualizations for uncertainty analysis
   - Create interactive dashboards for result exploration
   - Implement comparison views across model families

4. **Evaluation Enhancement**:
   - Add capability to only run specific conformal score functions 
   - Add capability to run only specific prompt strategies
   - Implement temperature testing to evaluate model robustness

## Usage Notes

- Use `quick_test.py` for a basic verification of the setup
- For MMLU dataset, make sure you have enough disk space as it's a large dataset
- When running the full benchmark, consider starting with a smaller sample size first
- The current implementation processes samples sequentially; parallelization is planned as a high priority
