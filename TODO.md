# Solution refinement tasks

As you start using the framework, here are some potential refinements you might consider:

1. **Dataset Handling**: The current implementation uses placeholder functions for loading some datasets. You might need to adapt these to properly load the actual datasets.

2. **API Integration**: Ensure the code for retrieving logits from your specific API is correctly implemented, as this can vary depending on the exact API response format.

3. **Parallelization**: For large-scale evaluations, you might want to add parallel processing capabilities.

4. **Result Storage**: Consider implementing a database or structured storage solution for results if you'll be benchmarking many models.
